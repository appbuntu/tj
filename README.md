# Theme Juice
Command line interface to scaffold out a new WordPress development environment and countless sites. Everybody loves one command setups, and `tj` even does one command deployments too.

## Installation
* First, install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for local development.
* Then, install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/) (make sure they're executable).
* Finally, you can run: `$ gem install theme-juice-cli`

That`s it!

## Usage

#### List available commands:
List all commands for `tj`.
```bash
tj
```

#### Setup VVV:
This command will _only_ setup [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV). It will not prompt you to create a new site. _Note: This is automatically run when you create your first site._
```bash
tj init
```

#### Create a new development site:
Use this to create a new development site. It will automagically set up your entire development environment, including a local development site at `http://<sites-dev-url>.dev` with WordPress installed and a fresh WP database. It will sync up your local site installation with the Vagrant VM. This task will also install and configure Vagrant/VVV into your `~/` directory if it has not already been installed. Site name is optional, as it will be asked for if not given.
```bash
tj create [<site-name>]
```

#### Setup an existing site:
Use this to setup an existing local site installation within the development environment. You will go through the setup process to create the necessary files for the VM, including `vvv-hosts`, `vvv-nginx.conf`, and a fresh database (unless one already exists by the name chosen). Site name is optional, as it will be asked for if not given.
```bash
tj setup [<site-name>] # Alias for 'tj create [<site-name>] --bare'
```

#### Delete a site from the VM: _(Does not remove your local site)_
Use this to remove a site from your development environment. This is only remove files that were generated by `tj`. including the database setup, development url, and shared directories. _It will not touch your local files._
```bash
tj delete <site-name>
```

#### List all sites in the VM:
Use this to list all sites within your development environment that were generated by `tj`.
```bash
tj list
```

```

#### Use for managing development environment: _(Vagrant)_
