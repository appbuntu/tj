# Theme Juice [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/theme-juice.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/theme-juice)
Command line interface to scaffold out a new WordPress development environment and countless sites. Everybody loves one command setups, and `tj` even does one command deployments too.

## Installation
* First, install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for local development.
* Then, install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/) (make sure they're executable).
* Finally, install with: `gem install theme-juice`

That`s it!

## Usage

### List available commands:
List all commands for `tj`.
```bash
tj
```

### Print version:
This command will print the current version of `tj`.
```bash
tj version
```

### Setup VVV:
This command will _only_ setup [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV). It will not prompt you to create a new site. _Note: This is automatically run when you create your first site._
```bash
tj init
```

### Creating a new development site:
Use this to create a new development site. It will automagically set up your entire development environment, including a local development site at `http://<sites-dev-url>.dev` with WordPress installed and a fresh WP database. It will sync up your local site installation with the Vagrant VM. This task will also install and configure Vagrant/VVV into your `~/` directory if it has not already been installed. Site name is optional, as it will be asked for if not given.
```bash
tj create [<SITE-NAME>]
```

#### Option flags: _(since `0.2.0`)_
| Flag                                    | Type   | Description                                      |
|:--------------------------------------- |:------ |:------------------------------------------------ |
| `-b, [--bare], [--no-bare]`             | Bool   | Create a VVV site without a starter theme        |
| `-s, [--site=SITE]`                     | String | Name of the development site                     |
| `-l, [--location=LOCATION]`             | Path   | Location of the local site                       |
| `-t, [--theme=THEME]`                   | Repo   | Starter theme to install (can use `none`)        |
| `-u, [--url=URL]`                       | URL    | Development URL of the site (must end in `.dev`) |
| `-r, [--repository], [--no-repository]` | Bool   | Initialize a new Git remote repository           |

### Setting up an existing site:
Use this to setup an existing local site installation within the development environment. You will go through the setup process to create the necessary files for the VM, including `vvv-hosts`, `vvv-nginx.conf`, and a fresh database (unless one already exists by the name chosen). Site name is optional, as it will be asked for if not given.
```bash
tj setup [<SITE-NAME>] # Alias for 'tj create [<SITE-NAME>] --bare'
```

### Deleting a site from the VM: _(Does not remove your local site)_
Use this to remove a site from your development environment. This is only remove files that were generated by `tj`. including the database setup, development url, and shared directories. _It will not touch your local files._
```bash
tj delete <SITE-NAME>
```

### Listing all `tj` sites in the VM:
Use this to list all sites within your development environment that were generated by `tj`.
```bash
tj list
```

### Watching and compiling assets: _(Guard)_
Use this to watch and compile assets with [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard). This is simply a wrapper for Guard commands.
```bash
tj watch # Alias for 'bundle exec guard [<COMMANDS>]'
```

### Managing development environment: _(Vagrant)_
Use this to easily manage your [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) development environment. This is simply a wrapper for Vagrant commands.
```bash
tj vm # Alias for 'cd ~/vagrant && vagrant [<COMMANDS>]'
```

### Managing vendor dependencies: _(Composer)_
Use this to easily manage your [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) dependencies. This is simply a wrapper for Composer commands.
```bash
tj vendor # Alias for 'composer [<COMMANDS>]'
```

### Managing deployment and migration: _(Capistrano)_

```bash
tj server # Alias for 'bundle exec cap [<COMMANDS>]'
```

### Executing WP-CLI locally inside your VM with `wp-cli-ssh`
You can run `wp` commands locally if you specify a `--host`. Upon setup, an `ssh` block for the VM is automatically added to the `wp-cli.local.yml` file with all of your development environment paths.
```bash
wp ssh --host=vagrant [<COMMANDS>]

# Create an alias
alias wpv="wp ssh --host=vagrant"
```
